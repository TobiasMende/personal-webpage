### Hi, I’m Tobi!
I help software companies develop better software faster, creating win-win-win scenarios for businesses, customers, and employees. With over 15 years in product, engineering, and organizational development, I empower leaders to build high-performing teams in tech.

### What I Do

**Consulting**  
I partner with leaders and their teams in software organizations, primarily in startups and scale-ups, focusing on SaaS. My goal? To help you build the right products the right way. This is why I co-founded [Tech Unicorn Builders](https://techunicorn.builders).

**Speaking**  
I share insights on leadership, high-performing teams, and engineering culture at conferences, events, and within organizations.

**Coaching**  
As a technical agile coach, I help teams create software with joy and less burnout. I also guide leaders in enhancing their skills and individuals in their personal development.

**Diving**  
Outside of work, I’m a technical diver, where I practice the art of listening. 😉

**Living Nomadic**  
Since 2019, I’ve called over 15 places home, immersing myself in diverse cultures and broadening my perspective. This nomadic lifestyle has enriched my understanding of people and deepened my empathy, which I bring into my work with clients.

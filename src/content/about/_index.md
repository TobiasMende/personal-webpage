## About Me

### Helping Founders Build Businesses That Run Smoothly — Without Becoming the Bottleneck

You started your business with passion and vision. But as your company grows, so do the challenges:

- More decisions demand your attention.
- Your team hesitates to take full ownership.
- Delegation feels impossible — things still land back on your plate.
- The quality isn’t where you want it to be, and stepping away seems risky.

This is a natural stage of growth, but it doesn’t have to stay this way.

I help founders **break free from being the bottleneck** by turning their companies into self-sustaining businesses — where teams take ownership, make smart decisions, and keep things running smoothly without constant oversight. The goal? **A business that thrives, even when you step away.**

### My Mission

For over 15 years, I’ve worked in **tech, product, and business operations**, helping startups and small & medium businesses build better products, scale their teams, and improve leadership structures. But I realized that **no tool or process alone can fix a company if leadership, decision-making, and operations don’t evolve with growth.**

Today, I work as a **sparring partner, advisor, and trainer** to help founders build the **right structures, processes, and leadership principles** so their businesses run smoothly, decisions happen at the right level, and teams take real responsibility.

This isn’t about “letting go” into chaos. It’s about **consciously designing an organization where people take ownership, decisions happen at the right level, and things move forward without unnecessary friction.**

### How I Work

I don’t believe in one-size-fits-all consulting. Every business is unique, and so is every founder. My approach is practical, collaborative, and tailored to what you and your company need.

🔍 **Gain clarity** – Identify what’s slowing down decision-making and execution.

🛠️ **Empower your team** – Build leadership structures that allow people to take ownership.

📈 **Streamline operations** – Reduce complexity, improve collaboration, and free up time for strategic focus.

The result? **Less stress, fewer roadblocks, and a business that works — without being dependent on any one person.**

### Who I Am

I’m Tobi — entrepreneur, leadership advisor, and sparring partner for founders who want **high-performing businesses without unnecessary stress.**

As a **digital nomad**, I’ve worked with founders across the world and seen firsthand how different cultures approach leadership, decision-making, and collaboration. I know that "right and wrong" are often contextual, that true resilience comes from adaptability, and that **great companies are built on trust and autonomy.**

Home is wherever the ocean is. As a **rebreather diver**, I know that true freedom comes when you **trust your system, stay calm under pressure, and let things run smoothly — just like in a well-functioning business.**

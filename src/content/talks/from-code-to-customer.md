Many organizations struggle with streamlining the software delivery process, resulting in slower delivery, lower quality, and decreased customer satisfaction. They also face challenges in establishing efficient CD pipelines and implementing cultural changes necessary for successful CD implementation.

This talk will explore the benefits of continuous deployment (CD) and its role in streamlining the software delivery process. It will cover technical aspects such as infrastructure as code, automated testing, and monitoring, as well as organizational benefits, such as faster delivery, higher quality, and increased customer satisfaction. I will share a real-world example to illustrate successful CD implementation across 15 teams with roughly 60 people.

You will gain a better understanding of the importance of CD in reducing the risk of software failures and enabling teams to respond quickly to customer feedback. You will also learn about the tools and techniques for creating an efficient CD pipeline and the cultural changes necessary for successful CD implementation, including collaboration, communication, and trust.

You will leave with practical strategies for implementing CD in your own organizations, leading to faster delivery, higher quality, and increased customer satisfaction. You will also have a better understanding of the technical and organizational benefits of CD and the cultural changes necessary for successful implementation.

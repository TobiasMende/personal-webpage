Creating a superior developer experience is key to motivating and streamlining engineering teams, serving as a strategic pillar for business success. Focus areas include optimizing workflow, reducing cognitive load, and establishing efficient feedback loops. As technology grows more complex, achieving these becomes increasingly challenging.

A dedicated Developer Experience (DevEx) team can significantly impact, especially in expanding organizations. In this talk, I’ll share our journey from 2021 to 2023 in founding and running a DevEx team within a hypergrowth startup. You’ll learn about our team member selection, building a high-performing group, and prioritizing impactful tasks.

We’ll also discuss our collaboration with other departments, address our challenges and mistakes, and share key lessons learned. By the end, you'll gain actionable strategies to empower your DevEx team, drive change, and enhance employee satisfaction, productivity, and business success.

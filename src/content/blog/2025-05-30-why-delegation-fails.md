> "You don’t have a delegation problem. You have a clarity and trust problem."

I used to think I was helping my team by staying involved. Answering every question. Checking every detail. In reality, I was slowing everyone down – including myself.

If you've ever said things like …
- “People always depend on me for decisions.”
- “I can't let go of this topic or quality will suffer.”
- “My team isn't experienced enough to handle this.”

… you might be facing the same challenge.

Over the years, in my own work and with clients, I've seen why delegation fails – and how to fix it.

## When Delegation Goes Wrong
A former client of mine, a CEO, once asked a team member to build a slide deck. The result? A polished presentation that completely missed the mark. What he actually needed was a simple internal document – short, simple, informative. The CEO was frustrated, felt misunderstood, and thought: "Next time, I’ll just do it myself."

Sounds familiar?

Together with the CEO, we analyzed the situation:

1. **No context was shared.** What’s the deck for? Who's the audience?
2. **No space for ownership.** He gave a task, not a problem to solve.
3. **No clarity on expectations.** How good is "good enough"?
4. **No alignment on autonomy.** Was this just execution, or was strategic input welcome?

After shifting how he delegated – by sharing more context, co-defining expectations, and trusting his people to think for themselves – he was able to step back without losing quality. Even better: His team appreciated the new autonomy and the ability to contribute on a meaningful level.

## The Difference Between Assigning and Delegating
- **Assigning a task** = "Do this."
- **Delegating responsibility** = "Make sure we achieve this result."

The first is a handoff. The second is a handover.

Founders often confuse the two. They delegate without alignment and then panic when the outcome doesn’t match their mental picture. The result? Micromanagement, lost trust, and frustrated teams.

## Why Delegation Fails (And What Most People Miss)
- **Lack of context.** People can't read your mind. If they don’t know the "why," they’ll default to their own logic.
- **Unclear expectations.** If you don’t define "good," it’s difficult to deliver it.
- **No trust system.** You say you trust your team, but check everything yourself.
- **Low autonomy.** Are they encouraged to challenge the project? Can they adapt the approach?
- **Task-based delegation.** If you're just offloading tasks, you’re not really delegating.

> Delegation isn't about letting go. It's about equipping others to care and carry.

## Quick Check-In: Are You the Bottleneck?
Use this list to reflect honestly. If you nod at several of these, it might be time to change how you delegate.
1. Do you regularly rewrite or redo work?
2. Are you the primary person making final decisions?
3. Are projects on hold when you're on vacation?
4. Do you often feel like it’s faster to “just do it yourself”?
5. Have you ever reversed a teammate’s decision because it wasn’t what *you* would have done?
6. Are projects stalled because you're not available to review or approve them?

## What Effective Delegation Looks Like
Here’s what I've found helps leaders (and myself!) delegate with confidence: **Use the Ladder of Delegation**

Discuss with your team what level of delegation is appropriate:
1. **Tell** – I make the decision and announce it.
2. **Sell** – I make the decision but try to convince you it’s right.
3. **Consult** – I ask for your input before deciding.
4. **Agree** – We decide together by consensus.
5. **Advise** – You decide, but I offer suggestions or input.
6. **Inquire** – You decide, and I ask afterward what you did.
7. **Delegate** – You decide, and I don’t follow up unless you tell me.

## How to Facilitate Delegation Poker
![Delegation Poker Card Deck](/img/blog/2025-05-30-delegation-poker.jpg)

**What it is:** A tool to align expectations around decision-making authority.

**How to play (remote or in-person):**

1. Pick a decision area (e.g., hiring, roadmap, pricing).
2. Each person privately chooses a card (level 1–7) that reflects how they think it *should* be delegated.
3. Reveal all cards. Discuss the differences. Find alignment.

**Why it helps:** It exposes unspoken assumptions, power gaps, and control habits.

**Tip:** It’s normal to discover you’re delegating *less* than you thought.

## Using a Delegation Map
A [Delegation Map](https://www.funretrospectives.com/delegation-map/) is a visual tool to identify responsibilities, current owners, and the *desired* level of delegation.

**Structure:**

- **Area or Topic** (e.g., Hiring, Product Strategy)
- **Current Decision Maker**
- **Desired Delegation Level**
- **Barriers/Dependencies**

**Before/After Example:**
- Before: “Product Strategy” is only decided by the founder.
- After: Strategy is co-created by PM and CPO, with founder in an advise-or-inquire role.

This map can also help spot where roles are ambiguous or overloaded.

## Delegation Traps to Avoid
Even experienced leaders fall into these traps:
- **False Delegation:** You assign responsibility, but retain all approval rights.
- **Silent Standards:** You don’t define what “good” looks like – and penalize people for missing your invisible bar.
- **Hero Syndrome:** You like being the fixer or the smartest person in the room.
- **Delegating Too Late:** You hand things off only when you’re overwhelmed, not when it’s optimal.
- **Delegating Too Early:** You give away critical thinking before people have enough context.

> Delegation isn’t just a skill – it’s a mirror: **It shows you where trust and systems are lacking.**

## Templates & Tools

### Delegation Brief
Use this when handing over a responsibility:
- **Context:** Why this matters
- **Goal:** What success looks like
- **Constraints:** Deadlines, budget, etc.
- **Support:** Who can help or review
- **Autonomy:** What level of freedom do they have?

### Weekly Delegation Check-In (Async or Live)
Ask these questions in your weeklies:
- What decisions are you waiting on me for?
- Where do you feel unclear about ownership?
- What do you need from me to move forward?

### Self-Reflection Questions for Leaders
Use these at least once a month (i.e., in your monthly review):
- Am I trusting or double-checking?
- Do I share enough context before delegating?
- Would I feel confident delegating this again?

## Try This With Your Team
### Step 1: Spot the Bottlenecks
Map your current roles and identify where you're the bottleneck.

### Step 2: Define Delegation Levels
Use Delegation Poker or a [Delegation Map](https://www.funretrospectives.com/delegation-map/) to visualize it.

### Step 3: Run a Safe Experiment
Pick one project or responsibility. Apply your new approach. Reflect on it after a week or two.

Want to go further? Run a "delegation retro" with your team. Ask:
- Where are we overdependent on one person?
- Where is clarity or context missing?
- What would help us distribute ownership better?

## Wrapping Up

If delegation feels hard, you're not alone. It’s a challenge many founders face – including myself. But the answer isn’t working harder or getting better at juggling. It’s about creating the clarity, context, and trust that lets others carry more of the load.

As a founder or leader, your job isn’t to be in every detail. It’s to make good decisions possible without you.

Getting better at delegation doesn’t happen overnight – but it starts with one honest conversation.

# Improving Developer Experience: Starting with Psychological Safety, Team Stability, and Work-Life Balance

As companies strive to foster an environment that promotes creativity, motivation, and productivity, they increasingly recognize the role Developer Experience plays in these efforts. 

With an optimized Developer Experience, organizations not only drive technological innovation but also improve engagement, performance, and retention. 

However, achieving this requires attention to several key areas. Their importance is based on the [Maslow Hierarchy of Needs](/blog/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-devex-edition/). 

Today we will start with the foundation of that pyramid, namely psychological safety, team stability, and work-life balance. This article will focus on these aspects, providing actionable strategies to enhance your engineers’ experience and your company’s overall success.

## Psychological Safety and Trust

To achieve outstanding results, people must collaborate, experiment and fail safely. This is the only approach to finding the best solutions in complex environments. Therefore, psychological safety has become pivotal. 

The concept, originally introduced by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson, refers to a shared belief that one won’t be punished or humiliated for making mistakes or voicing opinions. In a psychologically safe environment, people feel free to express their thoughts, take risks, and admit mistakes without fear of judgment or punishment.

To foster psychological safety, promoting an atmosphere of openness and mutual trust is crucial. One effective approach is to encourage personal connections among team members. 

Opportunities for interpersonal connection might include meetups in the kitchen, virtual coffee chats, check-in circles at the beginning of meetings, and synchronous collaboration such as team programming. Seemingly trivial, casual interactions are instrumental in building trust and understanding.

As a leader, your relationship with your team is undoubtedly important. However, it’s equally essential that team members form robust relationships among themselves.

An interconnected network within the team lays the groundwork for open communication and shared understanding. It also mitigates the risk of a “single point of failure” where employees only connect with the leader.

In essence, knowing each other better facilitates open communication and respectful discussions – all of which are crucial to creating a psychologically safe environment.

## Team Stability

While product development and software engineering are often characterized by change, stability remains a critical component of successful teams. Stable teams — those whose composition remains consistent over time — are typically more productive than a collection of individuals. 

This synergy arises from a profound understanding of each other’s strengths and weaknesses and the development of efficient ways to collaborate.

Stability, however, does not equate to rigidity. Teams should evolve based on internal needs rather than external forces. Adding new members should be a thoughtful process, giving new members adequate time to absorb the team’s culture before introducing additional new members. 

Moreover, decisions about team composition should be open to discussion, allowing for shared decision-making.

Respecting the stability of your teams pays off in their performance and satisfaction. However, many organizations undermine this by imposing top-down reorganizations without adequate conversation with the affected people. Such actions can disrupt the team dynamic, damaging productivity and the developer experience. 

When you anticipate changes, involve your teams early on. Their insights might lead to more effective solutions, and their involvement can foster a sense of ownership and acceptance.

## Work-Life Balance

Work-life balance is a familiar concept but one that warrants repeated emphasis. It’s less about the number of hours worked and more about the employee’s perception of their work. If your developers can’t switch off after work, feel obliged to always be available, or find work seeping into their personal time, it’s a sign that their work-life balance needs to be addressed.

As a starting point, treat employees as responsible adults. They should be able to determine when to be present and when to take time off. Furthermore, consider whether all meetings are necessary. Could the information be shared via a recorded session or any other asynchronous means instead?

Finally, make a point of regularly checking in with your team members. Their perception of their work-life balance is what ultimately counts. Initiate discussions on the topic, and consider conducting surveys to gain a broader understanding of team sentiments. Ensuring work-life balance significantly enhances your team’s experience and boosts productivity and retention.

## Conclusion

Improving the developer experience is not a one-off task but an ongoing commitment. 

By prioritizing psychological safety, team stability, and work-life balance, you’ll be well on your way to cultivating an environment where developers can thrive. Remember, the goal isn’t just happier developers; it’s also better solutions, improved performance, and a more successful organization.

If you care for business success, improving Developer Experience is a great way to start.

# Make three friends with one gift: Why developer experience is key to productivity, engineering excellence and stakeholder satisfaction.

In today’s fast-paced, technology-driven world, software development has become a critical aspect of many organisations. However, with increased demands on development teams, it’s easy to overlook the importance of developer experience. 

A positive experience for developers can have a ripple effect, resulting in improved productivity, better engineering practices, and ultimately, stakeholder satisfaction. In this article, I will explore why developer experience matters and what you can do to improve it.

## Productivity Boost

A great developer experience starts with providing your team with the right tools, resources, and structures. This can range from providing access to the latest technology to creating a comfortable and safe work environment. When developers have everything they need at their disposal, they can work more efficiently and produce higher-quality output.

When thinking about developer experience, it is easy to get lost in thinking about tools and technologies. However, culture, processes, and company structures can have a far bigger impact on developer experience and productivity.

In addition, streamlining workflows can help eliminate frustration and reduce the time spent on manual tasks. Automating repetitive processes and implementing _real_ agile methodologies can help developers focus on the tasks that matter most. And with _real_ agile, I mean that kind of agile that does not stop at artificial team- or department-boundaries and that be learned by reading books or joining courses but by continuously experimenting with the way you work. 

## Engineering Excellence

Investing in your team’s development experience can also lead to better engineering practices. When people work in an environment they need to do their jobs effectively, they are less likely to experience frustration and burnout. An “environment they need” ultimately is an environment people can shape as they need it. Therefore, it must be easy and possible for engineers to shape the way they work and deliver value.

Additionally, when developers feel valued and supported, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their work. This, in turn, leads to a more productive and creative team that can deliver innovative and well-designed solutions.

## Stakeholder Satisfaction

Finally, a positive developer experience can lead to greater stakeholder satisfaction. When your development team can deliver continuous value with quality, stakeholders are more likely to be satisfied with the results.

Moreover, happy developers often result in happy stakeholders. When your team is motivated and engaged, they are more likely to be productive, which can translate into higher quality output and more successful products.

I am convinced that the quality of the developer experience (or employee experience) inside a company will, eventually, become visible on the outside of the company. This can be in the way how customer requests are answered, the quality of the product, the degree of innovation and plenty of tiny details. Those aspects can make the difference between a highly successful company that is appreciated by customers and one that struggles with adoption.

## Investing in Developer Experience

Investing in developer experience can have a triple positive impact, so it’s important to consider it a priority. Here are some ways to improve the experience of your development team:

* Foster a culture of collaboration, open communication, and trust
* Communicate the vision and give teams the autonomy to figure out the best way to make it happen.
* Make sure teams have the support they need without imposing hierarchies. Think coaches, not managers.
* Streamline workflows and automate repetitive tasks
* Offer training and development opportunities to help your team stay current with industry trends and best practices
* Provide access to the latest technology and tools and give teams the freedom to use the right tools for their context.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, developer experience is a critical aspect of software development that should not be overlooked. 

* Provide your team with appropriate tools and resources.
* Create a positive work environment.
* Invest in team growth.
* Guide engineers to co-create a culture and environment that supports them.

This leads to productive, motivated and satisfied engineering teams. Such teams will consistently deliver high-quality software. This will result in high stakeholder satisfaction.

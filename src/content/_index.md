### Hi, Iâ€™m Tobi!

Iâ€™m passionate about helping software companies develop better software faster, creating a win-win-win scenario for companies, customers, and employees. With over 15 years of experience in product, engineering, and organizational development, I specialize in supporting leaders to build high-performing organizations and teams in the product and tech space.

### What I Do

**Consulting**  
I partner with leaders and their teams in software organizations, primarily in startups and scale-ups, focusing on SaaS. My goal? To help you build the right products the right way. This is why I co-founded [Tech Unicorn Builders](https://techunicorn.builders).

**Speaking**  
I love sharing insights on leadership, high-performing teams, self-organizing companies, engineering culture, and software craft. Whether at public events or within organizations, I strive to inspire and provoke thought.

**Coaching**  
As a technical agile coach, I support teams in building better software with more joy and less burnout. I also work with leaders to enhance their leadership skills and individuals on their career and personal development journeys.

**Diving**  
When Iâ€™m not helping teams thrive, you might find me underwater as a technical diver. Just shutting up and listening. ðŸ˜‰

**Living Nomadic**  
Since 2019, Iâ€™ve called over 15 places home, immersing myself in diverse cultures and broadening my perspective. This nomadic lifestyle has enriched my understanding of people and deepened my empathy, which I bring into my work with clients.
